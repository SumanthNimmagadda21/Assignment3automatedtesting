# Git Setup and Best Practices Guide

## 1. Initialize a New Git Repository and Commit All Files

Open your terminal in the project root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to the staging area
git add .

# Commit the files with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add existing project files with improvements"
```

## 2. Connect to a Remote GitHub Repository

If you have a remote GitHub repository, connect your local repository to it:

```bash
# Add the remote repository URL (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Push the local commits to the remote repository's main branch
git push -u origin main
```

If your remote branch is named differently (e.g., `master`), replace `main` with the correct branch name.

## 3. Best Practices for Commit Messages and Branch Management

- Write clear, concise commit messages describing the changes.
- Use the present tense and imperative mood, e.g., "Add input validation to calculation modules".
- Create feature branches for new features or fixes:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Regularly pull updates from the main branch to keep your branch up to date:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout feature/your-feature-name
  git merge main
  ```
- Push your feature branch to the remote repository:
  ```bash
  git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Open pull requests for code review and merging.
