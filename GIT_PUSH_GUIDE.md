# How to Push Your Assignment to a New GitHub Repository

Since you have created a new repository for this assignment, here is a step-by-step guide to push your local project to that new repository.

## Step 1: Initialize Git (if not already done)

```bash
git init
```

## Step 2: Add all files to staging

```bash
git add .
```

## Step 3: Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add assignment project files with improvements"
```

## Step 4: Add the remote repository

Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the URL of your new GitHub repository (HTTPS or SSH).

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
```

Example:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git
```

## Step 5: Push to the remote repository

If your default branch is `main`:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

If your default branch is `master`:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Troubleshooting Authentication Issues

- If you get permission errors, ensure you are logged in with the correct GitHub account.
- For HTTPS URLs, you may need to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password.
- For SSH URLs, ensure your SSH keys are set up and added to your GitHub account.
